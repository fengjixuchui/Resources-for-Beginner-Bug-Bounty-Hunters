# Resources-for-Beginner-Bug-Bounty-Hunters

## Mindset & Mental Health 🧘‍♂️

Bug Bounties is a task that can be very challenging and competitive and it can also hard to find the "right" entry point for some beginners. I wanted to have a small dedicated category where we can gather resources for you all to keep a healthy and good mindset to get the ball rolling, but also not to burn out too often.

(Thanks STÖK for putting out great videos regarding this point)
