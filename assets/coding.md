## Coding & Scripting ðŸ¤–

### Info
Many Beginners often ask if Coding is a necessaty for Bug Bounty.<br>
Short Answer: No.<br>
But as often discussed on @nahamsec Twitch Channel, it is a good Tool to have in General. Coding can help you a lot with understanding stuff that you will encounter on your Hacking Sessions, but it is also generally a good skill to have in the current times. You can automate your own Tools with Python for example, or write completely new ones if you have a specific task for it in mind. We will add a lot more in here over the next updates and also reorganize the Resources by Languages and so on.
